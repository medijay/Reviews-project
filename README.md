# Reviews-project
Reviews project using vanilla javascript...
In this project,i created two buttons.. basically a next and previous button to loop over the reviews 
and also a click me button to randomly navigate the reviews in the array. 
I also added some styling to the image container with css and also 
to change the button's styles when you hover over it using the hover CSS pseudoclass selector.
